**Hello!**

I'm a student on a journey to becoming a full-stack web developer with a passion for turning big ideas into polished digital experiences. I’m diving deep into both front-end and back-end development because, hey, why choose between the two when you can have the best of both worlds?

I believe that “Dream big, but build step by step” is more than just a motto—it’s a survival guide. Because let’s be honest: every great app starts with a bold vision... and then gets debugged into submission. My approach? Tackle the dream head-on, break it down into achievable goals, and maybe laugh a little at the chaos in between.

When I’m not wrangling code or chasing down elusive bugs, I’m busy turning everyday challenges into creative projects. Whether it’s crafting clean code or designing user experiences that just work, I strive to blend functionality with a touch of elegance (and maybe a little flair for fun).

Thanks for stopping by my portfolio! This is where big ideas, constant learning, and a dash of humor come together.

Let’s build something awesome together!
